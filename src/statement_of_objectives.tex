Assigned: Avery Clotfelter

\begin{itemize}
  \item Determine success of autonomous control algorithms in
    maneuvering a three CubeSat swarm from an initial launch position to a
    final formation in orbit.
  \item Investigate potential for inert, non-toxic propulsion systems
    for in attitude control and orbit maneuvers of 1U CubeSats.
  \item Optimize inter-university and community collaboration in space
    exploration and spacecraft development.
  \item Establish university satellite program at the University of
    Vermont in conjunction with Vermont Technical College.
  \item Build upon success of previous VTC CubeSat project through the use of proven technology and best practices.
  \item Explore the feasibility of PCB-integrated magnetorquers in
    increasing volume budget while maintaining pointing requirements.

\end{itemize}
